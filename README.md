## About
This is a custom application that I wrote to integrate a XML data feed from a third party application (Quadient Inspire) with the backend of a custom reporting and management tool.  It was my first exposure with batch updating a database from a table-valued parameter, which was done (as opposed to iterating the data updates) to optimize performance and minimize database cursors.
